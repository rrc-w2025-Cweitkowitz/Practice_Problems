"""
This py contains the module 2 problems

This unittest is designed to ensure each problem is working
effectively as well as improve my ability to unittest, seeing as how
I have not made unittests in months the simplicity of the module 2
problems should suffice in re-learning.

To execute this module in command-line where your present
working directory is the root directory of the project.

Example:
    python -m unittest Mod_2_and_3_prob/Module_2_Problems.py
    python -m unittest -k tests
